                 Hawa Mahal is a 5-storey structure that overlooks the bustling streets of Jaipur. 
                 It has also been made in a blend of the Rajput, Mughal and Islamic styles of architecture. 
                 Built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the Hawa Mahal has been constructed in a way such that the small windows here allow winds to enter the palace and keep it cool during the blazing hot summers.

            <p class="J">Built in the Dravidian style of architecture, the Meenakshi Amman Temple ranks as one of the most beautiful ancient places in India.
                 Built in the early 17th century, the temple is located on the southern banks of the Vaigai river in Madurai, Tamil Nadu.
                  Also known as the Sri Meenakshi Temple, this temple is primarily dedicated to Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva. 
                  The most striking part of the temple, however, is that both the god and goddess are worshipped together here.

            <h2>National Anthem Audio</h2>
            <p class="J">The national anthem of India, "Jana Gana Mana," was composed by the renowned poet Rabindranath Tagore. 
                It was first sung on December 27, 1911, at the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress. 
                The anthem, written in Bengali, was officially adopted by the Constituent Assembly as the Indian national anthem on January 24, 1950.
                The anthem's lyrics reflect the diverse cultural heritage of India and its unity in diversity, paying homage to the country's rich history and promising a bright future for its citizens.
                 The complete song consists of five stanzas, though the national anthem is composed of the first stanza only, which takes approximately 52 seconds to play.</p>
